## Velocity Improvement Documented

### Before (Serial)
```
Architect (1-2d) → Implementation (5-7d) → Testing (3-5d) → 
Review (1-2d) → Deploy (1d) = 10-16 days total
```

### After (Parallel)
```
Day 1: Architect designs
Days 2-3: Implementation + Testing + DevOps in parallel
Days 4-5: Review + Integration
= 3-5 days total (80% faster!)
```
